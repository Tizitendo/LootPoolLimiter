# LootPoolLimiter

Randomly remove a set amount of items from the itempool

## Settings

- Configure the amount of white, green and red items you want in your loot pool
- Set weight of blacklisted items, if you don't want to completely remove them and just want to make them less common
- Set category variance, allows you to have a more consistent pool, that will always have healing etc.
- option to apply on printers, void cradles and void keyboxes. Always applies on everything else
